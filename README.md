### Get started 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anotherlusitano/SpectrumPlus.git
cd SpectrumPlus
yarn
```

### How to compile

SpectrumPlus uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) to build and compile all styles into a minified version, making the filesize smaller.

**For development**

This will build the CSS file into the `/development/spectrum-testing.css`, which is ignored by git.

```sh
yarn dev
```

**For building**

When you're done working, make a PR and if it gets accepted and merged, autiomation will kick in and build a new CSS file.
